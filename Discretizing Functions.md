### The procedure
1. Choose basis -> "discretization method"
2. cut-off N -> "resolution"
3. show the result is independent of N -> "convergence"

### Example: P_l(x)
f(x) = \sum_i=0^N c^i P_i(x)

Plot the error w.r.t. the basis number N: log E(N)
Convergence region.

Floating-point number accuracy => log(E) eventually vibrates around -16 (the lower bound).
